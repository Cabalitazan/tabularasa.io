    <h2> HISTORY  </h2> 
    <p>  The Tabula Rasa University  was the first international school in France and today is recognized as a leading learning community. In its earliest stages, our school was made up of eight students and two certified teachers in the hallway of a diplomatic apartment compound. In 1980, amid the growth of other diplomatic communities, the US Embassy joined with the British, Australian, Canadian and New Zealand embassies and formally founded ISB.In January 2002, ISB was permitted to accept expatriate students outside of the diplomatic community. Since then, the school has flourished and quickly became a respected international school with programs and accreditation worthy of the breadth and depth of the school's vision.
