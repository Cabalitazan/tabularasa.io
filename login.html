<p class="tab">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The law affects every aspect of our lives; it governs ourconduct from the cradle to the grave and its influence even extends from before our birth to after our death.We live in a society which has developed a complex body of rules to control the activities of its members.There are laws which govern working conditions (e.g. bylaying down minimum standards of health and safety),laws which regulate leisure pursuits (e.g. by banning alcohol on coaches and trains travelling to football matches), and laws which control personal relationships(e.g. by prohibiting marriage between close relatives).So, what is ‘law’ and how is it different from otherkinds of rules? The law is a set of rules, enforceable by thecourts, which regulate the government of the state and govern the relationship between the state and its citizens and between one citizen and another. As individuals we encounter many ‘rules’. The rules of a particular sport,such as the off-side rule in football, or the rules of a club,are designed to bring order to a particular activity. Other kinds of rule may really be social conventions, such asnot speaking ill of the dead. In this case, the ‘rule’ ismerely a reflection of what a community regards to be appropriate behaviour. In neither situation would we expect the rule to have the force of law and to be enforced by the courts.</p>

Accounting is a system meant for measuring business activities,
processing of information into reports and making the findings available
to decision-makers. The documents, which communicate these findings
about the performance of an organisation in monetary terms, are called
financial statements. Usually, accounting is understood as the Language of Business.
However, a business may have a lot of aspects which may not be of
financial nature. As such, a better way to understand accounting could
be to call it The Language of Financial Decisions. The better the
understanding of the language, the better is the management of financial
aspects of living. Many aspects of our lives are based on accounting,
personal financial planning, investments, income-tax, loans, etc. We have
different roles to perform in life-the role of a student, of a family head, of
a manager, of an investor, etc. The knowledge of accounting is an added
advantage in performing different roles. However, we shall limit our scope
of discussion to a business organisation and the various financial aspects
of such an organisation.</p>

<img src="imgs/art-and-science.png" alt="Mountain View" style="width:1280px;height:600px;">
<p class="tab">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Modern art history starts in the Renaissance, when patrons
such as the Medici family began collecting Greco-Roman
objects. It did not unfold chronologically, but rather like a
puzzle—whose diff e rent pieces appeared at irre g u l a r
intervals, in places without any apparent link.
Another two centuries elapsed before scientists started to
show interest in prehistory. When cave art was discovered,
scholars were at a loss to determine its origin. Indeed, how
could they have imagined that such astonishing works were
made prior to biblical times? (The term “prehistory” was
coined in 1867.)
The history of art varied through time and from one
culture to another. Sculpture, for instance, was considered a
major art form in the Western world, whereas in Ancient
China it was regarded as just another product of manual
labor carried out by the lower classes. Conversely, in the
West writing was viewed as a communication tool, while in
China it was revered as the highest art.
For a long time, the story of art was one of styles. New
currents were received with scepticism. The Romanesque
style was named for its resemblance to Roman art, which was
considered unrefined. Gothic, from the word “Goth,” was
brought into use by Renaissance humanists, with pejorative
intent. Arrogance was expressed towards those whom critics
dubbed “Impressionists” or “Fauves”! (In science, too,
innovation can disturb; concepts such as “universal
gravitation” or the Big Bang were long subject to scientists’
scornful laughter.)</p>

<p class="tab">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is little possibility that you would come to a true understanding of the new global business environment or the mind set of an entrepreneur simply by reading about it. Reading must be complemented by discussion, involvement, critical thinking, and most importantly, decision making.
The experiences you gain in this program of study will lay a foundation for future learning in business and in life. If a student of business covers all of the essential areas of study but misses the "feel" or perhaps, the anguish of making critical decisions, then that student will only partly understand what business is all about. Given the importance of business in our society, it is essential that each team member have a hands-on business experience. Welcome to the Global View challenge!</p>

<p class="tab">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Architectural engineers bring together various
technologically advanced building systems
and make them all work together as an
integrated whole. They must be aware of the
practical, functional and aesthetic possibilities
of contemporary materials and mechanical,
electrical and structural systems to assure
proper building systems integration.
As an important member of the building design
team, the engineer must be able to create
designs that will satisfy the economic, safety,
environmental, sustainability and aesthetic
requirements of a project as well as assure
that the design complies with various design
standards and building codes.

<h3>
<head>Criminal Justice Education</head>
</h3>
<img src="imgs/forensics-body-outline.jpg" alt="Mountain View" style="width:1280px;height:550px;">
<p class="tab">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dantzker (2005) recently presented survey results of a purposive sample of criminal justice
students across ten universities (N = 663). Roughly 88% of the respondents indicated that
they were majoring in criminal justice because they are interested in obtaining criminal justice
employment upon graduation. Dantzker noted that the results suggest that the sampled students
believe that a criminal justice degree will aid them in their employment pursuit.
Typically, students receiving a 4-year college degree in criminal justice do so from a program
that, consciously or unconsciously, focuses either on preparing students to work in the
field as a police or corrections officer, or one that focuses on preparing students to think critically
within the context of criminal justice.

<p class="tab">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nurses are responsible for treating patients, educating patients about medical-related topics, and performing basic medical tests and procedures. Requirements for nurses vary by position and duties.Individuals interested in nurse training programs typically enroll in a year-long certificate, associate's degree, or bachelor's degree program in the field. Nurses in all fields of healthcare must have college-level training. Licensed practical nurses (LPNs) are typically required to have an associate's degree in nursing, while registered nurses (RNs) must have at least a 2-year degree, but a 4-year bachelor's degree in nursing is more common. Advanced nursing professionals, such as nurse practitioners or nurse specialists, are usually required to have a 2-year master's degree in nursing.

Nurses should have experience communicating with doctors and other medical professionals, caring for patients and performing various diagnostic medical tests. Experience is typically gained through clinical opportunities in undergraduate degree programs. There are several specializations available in the field, such as pediatrics, geriatrics, and mental health.

<head>Teacher Education</head>

<img src="imgs/teacher_board_book_chalk_formula_77472_2048x1152.jpg" alt="Mountain View" style="width:1280px;height:550px;">
<p class="tab">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teacher education or teacher training refers to the policies, procedures, and provision designed to equip (prospective) teachers with the knowledge, attitudes, behaviors, and skills they require to perform their tasks effectively in the classroom, school, and wider community. The professionals who engage in this activity are called teacher educators (or, in some contexts, teacher trainers).

There is a longstanding and ongoing debate about the most appropriate term to describe these activities. The term 'teacher training' (which may give the impression that the activity involves training staff to undertake relatively routine tasks) seems to be losing ground, at least in the U.S., to 'teacher education' (with its connotation of preparing staff for a professional role as a reflective practitioner).
