<p class="tab">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Libraries do curatorial work to preserve and provide access to the cultural
record. Print collections continue to dominate our focus, but Big
Data has made its way squarely into the library curatorial discussion, and
that is as it should be. Other materials such as audio and video recordings
also have their place in many of our research libraries. Various types
of image resources are relevant too. And I would include conventional
archival resources and archival organizations in this space: the curatorial
aspect of the missions and functions of archives and libraries are roughly
the same, and the curatorial methods are certainly the same, as well. Curation
not only covers preservation and access, particularly for electronic
resources, but also includes selection, description, and organization.
Libraries are best known to their constituencies and to the profession
itself for their curatorial role. Curation provides the underpinnings for
other things we do, and curating the collection is the most enduring part of
our work. It is sometimes seen as the creation of truths, or at least as work
that transcends bias. Yes, we select, and thus show bias, but a core tenet of
collection development is acknowledging and surmounting bias. </p>
